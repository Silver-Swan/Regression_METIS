- This was the first graph that I was able generate. This a pairplot I was able to get after finally getting the hang of web scraping. The plot here represents total profit, number of title releases, and lifetime gross.
<br>

-  The next steps would be to include more features like budget, release date, and any other features that can help with a linear regression model. Then create a OLS model/fit to the model.

- The outliers could represent the few moview that genres that have been made most often.
