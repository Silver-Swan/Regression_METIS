# Project Proposal for the movie studio on what the next movie project should be.
----

- Question: 
The goal of this project will be to show the studio what type of movie to produce next. By using the linear regression model to analize certain movie features where the target would be the gross profit made from those movies, a rough prediction can be made on the type of movie will be the most profitable.

- Data Description:
The sites where I'll get most of the information will be [Box Offic Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/?ref_=bo_nb_ql_mojologo). List of top gross genres, top gross movies worldwide, and top MPAA ratings. By using the gross value as the continuous numerical value, I plan to show that by focusing  depending on the catagories of genres, MPAA, and popular movies worldwide

- Tools:
Using web scraping tools such ash Beautiful Soup to grab information from the website. Then using pandas to sort and store the information into a data frame and using seaborn to create graphs to illustrate my ideas.

- MVP Goal:
To show the movie people/team/writer whether to make the movie/where to market the movie/where the movie will do well.
