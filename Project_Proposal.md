# Project Proposal for the movie studio on what the next movie project should be.
----

- Question: 
The goal of this project will be to show the studio what type of movie to produce next. By using the linear regression model to create a rough prediction model that can provide information on the type of movie that will be the most profitable.

- Data Description:
The sites where I'll get most of the information will be [Box Offic Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/?ref_=bo_nb_ql_mojologo). List of top gross genres, top gross movies worldwide, top MPAA ratings, and release date. Using the gross profit made as the target value and the categories as features of a linear regression model, I plan to create a prediction model for the movie studio.

- Tools:
Using web scraping tools such as Beautiful Soup to grab information from the website. Use datetime to change the type of the release date to help with the cleaning of the data. Then using pandas to further clean, sort, and store the information into a data frame and using seaborn to create graphs to illustrate my ideas. 

- MVP Goal:
To show the movie studio, with a linear regression model and graphs, what movie to produce and when to release.
